# Demo Code from VSLive Chicago

This repository has code and instructions from demos that I gave at
[VSLive Chicago 2018](https://vslive.com/Events/Chicago-2018).

The talk was called ["Kubernetes and Containers for Developers"](https://vslive.com/Events/Chicago-2018/Sessions/Thursday/TH05-Kubernetes-and-Containers-for-Developers.aspx)
