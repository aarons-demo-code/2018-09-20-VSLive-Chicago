# Demo Code from VSLive Chicago

Welcome VSLive 2018! :heart:

This repository has code and instructions from demos that I gave at
[VSLive Chicago 2018](https://vslive.com/Events/Chicago-2018).

The talk is called ["Kubernetes and Containers for Developers"](https://vslive.com/Events/Chicago-2018/Sessions/Thursday/TH05-Kubernetes-and-Containers-for-Developers.aspx).

To run all the demos in this repository, you'll need 
[Docker](https://docker.com) installed. If you need to install it, see 
[these instructions](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
